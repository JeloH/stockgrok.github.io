                <p>Coming into this project, our team of five designers had very little experience with finance or accessibility. The challenge in the research phase was to gain a solid grasp on both the accessibility and finance domains. We began with a secondary research phase, which consisted of empathy exercises, literature review, and interviews with accessibility subject matter experts. With this foundation in place, we conducted a contextual inquiry, which focuses on speaking with people in the context of their recent experiences as applicable to the domain. We interviewed both people with visual impairments and sighted finance experts, using the affinity diagramming method to find patterns across the notes we took during all of these interactions. We ended up with six key insights that helped guided the design of Stockgrok.

                    As five sighted designers designing for people with visual impairments, we sought ways to confront our misconceptions about the abilities and disabilities of our target users. We first researched best practices for empathy exercises (also known as disability simulations), and learned that empathy exercises should be created and run in context of the tasks and tools in question, with the knowledge that people who are blind develop expert skills for adapting to the world without sight – skills which can't be approximated through a few minutes with a blindfold.
                </p>
                <p>In this way, we focused on learning how to use the Apple VoiceOver screen reader to check our own financial information. This experience helped us approximate the pain points of our specific problem space without making any claims at understanding the full lived experiences of people with visual impairment. Our team experienced firsthand many common difficulties while navigating finance applications with VoiceOver: difficulties that would soon be validated and echoed in our interviews with visually impaired screen reader users.

                    Contextual Inquiry focuses on interviewing people in the context of, interpreting those interviews into individual notes, and synthesizing insights from those notes in a bottom up fashion. We began by talking with ten people with visual impairments, as well as six sighted finance experts. We walked through the financial workflow for each user, focusing on interactions with technology. For people with visual impairments, we sought to understand how assistive technology fits into these interactions.

                    As an example, we would ask an interviewee to walk us through the process of checking their finances via online banking. With sighted finance experts, we focused more on the decisions making process of buying and selling securities. We would ask an interviewee to take us through a recent buy or sell decision, from becoming aware of the security, researching it, and finally making the final call, how they would make decisions. Teammates would interpret the interviews and condense them into a set of individual notes. From there, notes were placed onto an affinity diagram, which is a clustering framework designed to help find patterns within qualitative data. We gained a number of insights from this diagram, six of which we found most promising for evaluating our future designs.

                    The process of making a buy or sell decision is very long. We wanted to focus our designs on a slice of that process. We developed a general task flow that our product would need to address. Given that we were working with data visualizations, it made most sense to highlight the portion of the process where experts are looking at price history. Our first iteration of this task flow focused on the expert’s usage of candlestick charts, as well as identifying important cross points. Once we understood the cross points to be more important, we updated our task to reflect the time experts spend making sense of price as a relation to other indicators.

                        When we sat down with specialists at Bloomberg, we focused our questions around candlestick charts (also known as Open-High-Low-Close charts). This very visual way of portraying a security over time seemed like a good place to start. These interviews introduced us to technical analysis, which involves focusing on price history as a way of predicting future prices. </p>
                    <p>Specialists used indicators (for example, a 50 day simple moving average maps the average close price of the last 50 days) to elucidate where trends were beginning and ending. Over time, we realized that technical analysts were using these indicators, regardless of the type of chart. It made more sense to move away from candlesticks, and focus more on providing price context, something which people with visual impairments did not previously have access to.</p>

                    <p>Our biggest takeaway from speaking with specialists was that price is not nearly as important as its relationship to these indicators. This insight led us to make these important occurrences non-visually salient.</p>
                    <p>
                        We identified the cross point as a cue indicating that a trend may be changing. The other side of this decision is tracking when a price either gets close to, but doesn’t cross over, a moving average or is very far away from it. While obvious visually, we saw an opportunity to leverage the magnitude of distance between the two lines at any given point as a way to. The magnitude of the difference between a price line and an associated indicator allows users to notice when the two lines are close to crossing, or when they are far apart.

                <p tabindex="0" class="sec-subhead">We drew on both our secondary research findings and contextual inquiry findings to formulate a number of insights, told from the perspective of a person with a visual impairment. We settled on six of these insights to present in our research book, <em>What Am I Missing?</em></p>
