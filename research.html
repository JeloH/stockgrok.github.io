                    <p tabindex="0">To help make sense of our wide-reaching interviews and literature review, we combined all of our notes and organized them, over time, into clusters representing emergent themes. Four main clusters arose from this process:

                        <li>Technology values of people with visual impairments, which focuses on how people with visual impairments adopt and use technologies, and the reoccurring pain points that occur with inaccessible technology</li>
                        <li>Modes of data transfer, which focuses on how data is translated into different modalities (visual to aural or tactile), and how data is interpreted from these alternative senses
                        </li>
                        <li>Interpreting data, which focuses on the need for the context of data, as well as being able to access it in a timely manner</li>
                        <li>General design, which focuses on the overlap between accessibility technology and general design principles</li>

                    <p>
                        From there, data is broken down into more discrete groups and individual notes in support of these clusters.

                    <p tabindex="0">As sighted individuals designing for people with visual impairments, we found it necessary to put ourselves in the shoes of our potential users. We first researched best practices for empathy exercises (also known as disability simulations), and learned that we should be careful in how we ran one; specifically we came to the conclusion that empathy exercises should be created and run in context. In this way, we focused on learning how to use the Apple VoiceOver screen reader to check our own financial information. This experience helped us understand the pain points of our specific problem space, and helped prepare us to design specifically for visual accessibility in finance.

We combined these insights with support from our secondary research to synthesize fifteen insights, six of which we presented to Bloomberg, as the most promising directions for our design direction.
