                <p>Coming into this project, our team of five designers had very little experience with finance or accessibility. The challenge in the research phase was to gain a solid grasp on both the accessibility and finance domains. We began with a secondary research phase, which consisted of empathy exercises, literature review, and interviews with accessibility subject matter experts. With this foundation in place, we conducted a contextual inquiry, which focuses on speaking with people in the context of their recent experiences as applicable to the domain. We interviewed both people with visual impairments and sighted finance experts, using the affinity diagramming method to find patterns across the notes we took during all of these interactions. We ended up with six key insights that helped guide the idea generation process that followed.

                    As five sighted designers designing for people with visual impairments, we sought ways to confront our misconceptions about the abilities and disabilities of our target users. We first researched best practices for empathy exercises (also known as disability simulations), and learned that empathy exercises should be created and run in context of the tasks and tools in question, with the knowledge that people who are blind develop expert skills for adapting to the world without sight – skills which can't be approximated through a few minutes with a blindfold.
                </p>
                <p>In this way, we focused on learning how to use the Apple VoiceOver screen reader to check our own financial information. This experience helped us approximate the pain points of our specific problem space without making any claims at understanding the full lived experiences of people with visual impairment. Our team experienced firsthand many common difficulties while navigating finance applications with VoiceOver: difficulties that would soon be validated and echoed in our interviews with visually impaired screen reader users.

In addition, we also took many valuable insights from this process, including a strong understanding of how design decisions alter the workflow of people with visual impairments, how they decide to adopt new technologies (or not!), and a better knowledge of the experience of people with visual impairments in the workplace.
